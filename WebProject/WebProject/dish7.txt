2 lbs bone in skin on chicken thighs 6-8 thighs
2 tbsp honey
2 tbsp whole grain mustard
1 tbsp dijon mustard
6 cloves garlic minced
1 tbsp oil


To bake plain thighs, just season the thighs with salt, pepper, and a touch of oil and bake them, omitting the honey mustard, and garlic. To get some browning on top, broil for 5 minutes, keeping an eye on the oven.

1. Lightly pat the chicken skin dry and season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Place in an oven safe baking dish.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, mustard, garlic, and oil. Pour over the chicken and make sure the thighs are evenly coated. Let temper in a cool spot in your kitchen for about 10-15 minutes then heat your oven to 425°F.
3. Bake the chicken for 25-30 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F. Let rest for a couple minutes, then enjoy!
